			<h2>Radiochemistry scintillation detector development (Master's project)</h2>
			<p>Positron emission tomography uses radionuclides which are naturally existing molecules in the body with radioactive atoms attached. The automated synthesis of useful radionuclides involves a number of sophisticated synthesis and purification steps. At each step, there is loss of radioactivity, which is monitored using highly accurate but expensive radiation detectors to ensure that the correct radiochemical processes are taking place. The goal of this project is to design and develop a small, portable, and low-cost multichannel detector to follow the transfer of radioactivity during the automated syntheses of radionuclides used in positron emission tomography.</p>
			<p>I am developing the detector using scintillating fibers, silocon photomultipliers, microelectronics, and a microprocessor. All of the components are inexpensive and add up to only about a couple hundred dollars per channel. This is a significant reduction in cost compared to the commercialized radiation detectors that costs anywhere from $2,000-10,000 per channel. </p>
